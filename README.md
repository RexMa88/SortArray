a demo explain NSArray how to sort by using Core Foundation Method.


NSSortDescriptor is a class that describe how to sort in a Array(or Dictionary).
and,the sort in NSSortDescriptor way is number transform to string,so it is sorted by ASC2.

I add a desc sort in the project,and I will push some good sort algorithms.
